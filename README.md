# Overview

To launch the Docker-Compose stack, execute:
```
git clone https://github.com/cswclui/redis-shop-ex
cd redis-shop-ex
docker-compose up
```

The `docker-compose.yaml` will launch the following Docker containers:
- **redis**: Redis Database Server. You may connect to it using host port 6379
- **redisinsights**:  You can view the Redis data at `http://localhost:8001` using the Redis Insights app.  In PolyU Vlab platform, you can use the `Show Port` feature in the navigation bar (input "8001" and click `Show Port`). Connect to the Redis database by specifying the hostname `redis` and port `6379`.

The script `redis-py-demo.py` contains sample code for connecting to the Redis database (localhost:6379) and working with different data types using the redis-py library. 

```
python3 redis-py-demo.py
```
 
 # Task
First, run the python script `processor.py` to parse the orders,products and user json data and store the data/summary in Redis database in the `redis` container.

```
python3 processor.py
```

Define the various functions in `summary.py` to complete the tasks based on the data generated by the processor script in Redis.

Use should make use of the redis-py library.
